# SVG-logo-maker

## Description
This is my SVG logo generator. It works by prompting the user to answer a series of questions concerning 
SVG logo properties, and returns a generated logo based off the answers provided by the user. It is very simple
and user friendly, and does not require any sort of installation. It does, however, work off hexidecimal code, and thus the user
should research online what the hex codes are for the desired colours.
